        <h2>EARTH</h2>
        <p>Earth, our home planet, is the third planet from the Sun and the only known place to harbor life. It is a dynamic world of land, water, and air, with about 71% of its surface covered in water. Formed about 4.5 billion years ago, Earth has a molten core, a flowing mantle, a rocky crust, and a protective atmosphere. Its unique characteristics, including the right temperature, liquid water, and a stabilizing Moon, make it the "Goldilocks planet" and a perfect fit for life as we know it.</p>

        <p>Cricket is a popular bat-and-ball sport played between two teams of eleven players each. Originating in England, it is now widely followed, especially in countries like India, Australia, and England. The game involves batting, bowling, and fielding, with the objective for the batting team being to score as many runs as possible, while the opposing team attempts to dismiss them and limit their score. Matches can range in duration from several hours for the fast-paced Twenty20 (T20) format, to up to five days for Test matches, which require physical and mental endurance. Beyond the field, cricket has evolved into a global phenomenon, fostering teamwork, discipline, and a sense of community among players and fans alike.</p>
