<p>Elephants are the largest living land animals, known for their immense size, intelligence, and complex social behavior. They possess several distinguishing features, including a long, prehensile trunk used for breathing, drinking, and grasping objects. Their tusks are actually elongated incisor teeth, and their large ears help regulate body temperature. Elephants live in matriarchal herds and are considered a keystone species, playing a crucial role in shaping their ecosystems.</p>
